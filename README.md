Using 3rd party APIs to create a quiz

## Description

This is an interactive javascript based quiz to test your knowledge about javascript. I built this to test my own knowledge about javascript and my own understanding of js (kind of need to know the correct answers before writing the answers hahaha). I wanted to be able to store users score in order of highest to lowest, and have you beat the clock. Don't worry there are only 5 questions (so far) so this is relatively simple and easy. I wanted to build this as an enjoyable interactive fun test of knowledge, where you can compare your high scores and share amongst your friends to build on you knowledge.

This was very tricky for me to complete as a beginner but I wanted to test my limits with this and identify where I need to focus more with my own understanding with js. My goal here is to have a functioning app that does stores high scores with your initials, tells you if your correct or incorrect and decuct points for every wrong answer.

This app has the potential to become more complex, which is another motivation for why I wanted to make this. In the future I would love to add more complex questions to really challenge you. I would also love to make this more creative by adding in more CSS that is closer to my personal style for fun.

Overall, I learnt a lot about javascript and how much you can do with it. Some tasks were more complex than others but I feel like I'm finally learning the fundementals (I may be using my own app to stregthen my knowledge also). So, if you have time, please take the quiz and leave feedback on what would make it better, more complext etc.
